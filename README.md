<h1> Online Cinema Ticket & Seat Booking System <h1>

Online Movie Ticket Booking System (OMTBS), Web-Based System in which clients or users can buy the related movie ticket on the web associate and meanwhile drop the seat at an acceptable time (2 days before the show to 1hour before the show). To enhance the discount work, each one of the client or users must enrolled and become part before getting price ticket. 
Staff will utilize the framework to enroll and erase data (film description, Movie-time table, seat no and other info) which is able to refresh the main page (site page are dynamic page, ever-changing as per the data in database). Likewise, it will save the time and effort of going to the theater and book price ticket and staff can measure the given data of the user or client from the system and can use for the further purpose.   


<h2> Aims and objectives <h2>
<h3> Aims <h3>
The aim of this project is to provide user to information about the recent movies and cinema and book the seat.

<h3> Objectives <h3>
-> allows the users to provide the information related to movies, cinemas from any location and make current seat book to that cinema.
-> allows the users to get the exact location and details of the cinemas
-> to see the location to the map where user can search on google.
-> to implement different sensors i.e. using proximitry and light sensor.
-> to implement different hardware i.e. vibrate when login to the application 
-> to add a heptic feed back.

<h3> Features <h3>
the features that the app consists are:
-> allow the user to create an account and login.
-> allow the user to access the application.
-> allow user user-friendly to the application.
-> allow user the real time information of the application.

<h2> REST Client(Retrofit 2) <h2>
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy 
to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. 
In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. 
Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process 
XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.

To work with Retrofit you basically need the following three classes:

-> Model class which is used as a JSON model

-> Interfaces that define the possible HTTP operations

-> Retrofit.Builder class - Instance which uses the interface and the Builder API to allow defining the URL end point for the HTTP operations.

Every method of an interface represents one possible API call. It must have a 
HTTP annotation (GET, POST, etc.) to specify the request type and the relative URL. 
The return value wraps the response in a Call object with the type of the expected result.

<h1> Conclusion <h1>
In the end, the project was completed with the implementation of different sensors and getting 
the data from the backend and the integration of the map. there were different problem that occured while
working on this project. But kepping things apart, the project was completed with the requirements
that was set limit and provided to us.
